# recycling

Welcome to the recycling assistant app!

I worked on this project without any teammates, so I wasn't able to deploy the way I wanted to, especially since my files were too large for Heroku.

Quick demo:

Prerequisites:

* Python (typically Python 3.x)
* Git (for version control and cloning the repository)
* Virtual Environment (optional but recommended for isolating project dependencies)

1. Clone the Repository:
Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

bash
Copy code
git clone [GitHub_repo]](https://github.com/michellebau/recycling

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd [recycling]
3. (Optional) Set Up a Virtual Environment:
First, install virtualenv if you haven't, Activate the virtual environment:

run: pip install -r requirements.txt
run: python app.py

Open a web browser and navigate to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or localhost:3000

Again, I worked by myself on this project so I was only able to train my AI on alumnium cans, digital camera, lead acid batteries, paper coffee cups, and plastic utensils.
